## Overview

My 5th challenge on the frontend mentor website showed me gaps in my knowledge I intend to fill/fix in the immediate future.
it was fun and VERY challenging especially for resposiveness, I think I did really good but I'll definitely come back to this one to refactor it as I learn more about best practices, responsiveness, backgrounds, etc...

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- Using fixed widths and heights is gonna spell trouble for responsiveness.

- I'll start focusing on the planning phase more from now on, I underestimated this one and didn't give too much thought about how to accommodate for mobiles in the planning phase.

### Continued development

Since I struggled immensely with responsiveness on this one, I'll be focusing on studying responsiveness from multiple resources. I'll also start to seriously looking into mobile-first design for the upcoming projects.
